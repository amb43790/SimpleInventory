Email a report about items at 0 or 1.

Add a column to item to flag an item as active/inactive.  Don't include
inactive items in the above report

Add a flag to orders to mark them as shipped/confirmed.  Set the flag
after confirm-shipping and then confirm-shipping can warn about how many
unconfirmed orders are left

Figure out how to print the barcode for orders on the picklist.  Maybe create
PDFs?  Also, print out packing lists for picklist orders.

Find a way to import orders from ZenCart and generate picklists like for
Amazon orders

Purchase Orders - make a list of things we've ordered that can be checked in
later by receiving a purchase.  Works like a picklist for received things


****

Change the 'count' property in Inventory::Item to be directly through
the OrderItemDetail class instead of indirectly through orders
